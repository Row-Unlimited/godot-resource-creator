TODOs:
	- Export Tree UI changes:
		+ Implement Buttons for Objects:
			~ Toggle Switch export as json (maybe also in create Object)
			~ delete object button
			~
	- Re-Implement Warnings
		- var in inputManager where current error_object is saved, that is used when show_input_warnings is called
		current_errors setup implemented in:
			- Default
			- bool needs no implementation
		- To Improve Warnings I need to improve UI
			+ Change Input Scene Root node from container to panel
			+ make the panel only visible to the right of the indent
			+ Main issue is that I now have to calculate a custom min size since the panel is seen as size 0 else
			+ to get the indentation right I changed the arrays/dicts so they hold grid_container where the first element is a marginContainer
	
	- UI-Improvements:
		+ Change create_object from VBoxContainer to control so borders can be better processed and don't get hidden
