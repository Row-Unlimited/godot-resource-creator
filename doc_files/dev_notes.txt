TODOs:
	- Export Tree UI changes:
		+ Implement Buttons for Objects:
			~ Toggle Switch export as json (maybe also in create Object)
			~ delete object button
			~
	- Re-Implement Warnings
	- Rework json export helper func so it can work with objects in some capacity
	- Rework lower half of create object UI, so it includes a checkbox for Export as Json
	- Remove Error Enum and replace it with a String Array to make sure there is not type confusion with normal int values
